## Tips

### Good Prompt Structure
```markdown
1. Role definition: "You are a [expert] that..."
2. Task guidelines: "When reviewing code, check for..."
3. Output format: "Always respond with..."
4. Constraints: "Never suggest..."
```

### Make Prompts Reusable
- Use placeholders: "Review the following {language} code..."
- Keep instructions general, not tied to specific examples
- Include output format expectations

### Organize with Prefixes
```
code-review.md
code-explain.md
code-refactor.md

email-professional.md
email-casual.md

writing-blog-post.md
writing-documentation.md
```
